# You have a hundred cats
# One day, you decided to arrange all your cats in a giant circle. Initially, none of your cats has a hat on. You walk
# around the circle a hundred times, always starting with the first cat. Each time you stop at a cat, you check if it
# has a hat on. If it doesn't, then you put a hat on it. If it does, then you take the hat off.
